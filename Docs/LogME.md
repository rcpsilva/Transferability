### Logarithm of Maximum Evidence (LogME): A Transferability Metric

The Logarithm of Maximum Evidence (LogME) is a computational method used to evaluate the transferability of pre-trained models without the need for fine-tuning. This metric provides a quantitative assessment of how well a pre-trained model can be expected to perform on a new task, based on the features extracted from the model.

### Mathematical Definition of LogME:
The LogME score is computed using the formula:
\[ \text{LogME} = \frac{1}{n} \log p(y | F, \alpha, \beta) \]
where:
- \( y \) represents the labels of the target task.
- \( F \) denotes the features extracted by the pre-trained model.
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are parameters optimized to maximize the evidence \( p(y | F) \).
- \( \frac{1}{n} \) normalizes the score by the number of samples, ensuring it does not scale with the dataset size.

### Intuition:
LogME measures the maximum log likelihood of the labels given the features under a Bayesian framework, integrating over all possible parameter values. A higher LogME value suggests that the pre-trained modelâ€™s features align well with the label distribution of the new task, indicating better transferability.

### Calculation Example:
Suppose you have extracted features from a pre-trained model for a dataset with the following instances and their labels:

- Features for instance 1: \( [0.5, 1.2] \)
- Features for instance 2: \( [0.6, 0.9] \)
- Features for instance 3: \( [0.8, 1.1] \)

And suppose these instances belong to classes 0 and 1 with labels `[0, 1, 1]`. The steps to calculate LogME would be:

1. **Calculate the feature covariance matrix \( \Sigma_f \)**:
   - Compute the covariance matrix of the features.

2. **Optimize parameters \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \)**:
   - Use an optimization algorithm to find the values of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) that maximize the log likelihood of the evidence.

3. **Compute LogME**:
   - With optimized \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), compute the normalized log evidence as per the LogME formula.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def log_likelihood(alpha, beta, features, labels):
    n = len(labels)
    F = np.array(features)
    y = np.array(labels).reshape(-1, 1)
    I = np.eye(F.shape[1])

    # Compute covariance matrix of features
    Sigma_f = np.cov(F, rowvar=False) + I * 1e-5  # Regularization for numerical stability
    Sigma_f_inv = np.linalg.inv(Sigma_f)

    # Log evidence calculation (simplified for demonstration)
    log_evidence = -0.5 * n * np.log(np.linalg.det(Sigma_f) + alpha + beta) + np.trace(Sigma_f_inv)
    return -log_evidence / n  # Negative for minimization

def compute_LogME(features, labels):
    result = minimize(lambda x: log_likelihood(x[0], x[1], features, labels), [1, 1], bounds=((1e-5, None), (1e-5, None)))
    return -result.fun  # Convert back to positive LogME

# Example features and labels
features = [[0.5, 1.2], [0.6, 0.9], [0.8, 1.1]]
labels = [0, 1, 1]

# Calculate LogME
logME_value = compute_LogME(features, labels)
print("Calculated LogME:", logME_value)
```
